## Why the data is not 4nf compliant

The table contains many multi-valued dependencies such as professor, due date and assignment topic, making it so a single professor or course can have multiple values for assignments, readings, and grades that do not depend on each other. Additionally, the original table does not seperate the entities into logical groupings which is nedded for higher normal forms. The table also includes many implicit relationships such as between assignments and grades that are not managed using foreign keys. There is also no clearly identified primary key that uniquely defines each record. However, in 4nf each table must include a primary key so that every data item is properly uniquely identified.

## Changes made
To make the table compliant with 4NF, I split the table into several different tables such as courses, professors, students and assignments. Seperating these tables ensures that each table focuses on a single entity which in turn reduces redundancy and also improves data integrity. I also added a sections table to create clearer seperation between courses and their logistics which addresses the issue where different sections of the same course could meet at different times or with different professors. I also added surrogate keys like section_id and reading_id to make sure each record could be uniquely identified.
